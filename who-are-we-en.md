# Who are we?
The founders of Karibou.ch SA, Delphine Cluzel and Olivier Evalet, share a vision of the world that is based on more values and more civic responsibility. Knowing what is in one's plate and promoting local trade are part of this ethic. The birth of their two daughters will crystallize this desire. To reconcile healthy eating with the fast pace of city and family life, they combine their two loves – quality products and the web – to bring together the best craftsmen in Geneva on karibou.ch.

## Delphine Cluzel
Delphine is first known as the co-founder of the Weetamix club. Passionate about electro music, she dedicated a part of her younger years to mixing and organizing parties at the mythical Halle W. She will keep from it an unshakeable sense of logistics. Patient and tenacious, she also brings to Karibou a background in marketing, thanks to which she manages the financial, legal, and promotional aspects of the company.

## Olivier Evalet

He is the very definition of a geek. A self-taught soul, passionate about physics, electronics, and computer science, Olivier is a staunch advocate of open source and its potential for societal change. A former scientific collaborator at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, he developed the karibou.ch site and authored the unique software "Karibou Marketplace," a [peer2peer](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_%C3%A0_pair) solution serving a local food economy.
