### How does it work
Karibou.ch is a local technology to promote craftsmen, producers, and grocers from the canton.

Karibou.ch functions like a physical market; it is composed of **independent shops**, which together form the online market. We provide an IT infrastructure and a logistics infrastructure to facilitate the relationship between customers and sellers.

## 1. Shop at your market
You order directly from the producer, the craftsman, and the grocer.
* You buy what you want in the desired quantities
* See who [produces and prepares your food](https://karibou.ch/store/artamis/home/shops)
* You pay the same price for the products as you would in the store!

## 2. We prepare your order
During the morning, we collect your orders directly from the producers, craftsmen, and gourmet grocery stores. You are delivered in the afternoon. We have no stock; the craftsmen manufacture to order, so there is no waste!

## 3. We deliver to your door
You choose your delivery location, and our cyclists deliver to you by bike. The delivery is carried out by our partners [VÃ©lo Vert](http://www.velovert.ch/) and [Cyclomoov](https://cyclomoov.ch/index.html)
* We respect the environment and ensure fast delivery, no traffic jams!
* We deliver every day of the week - depending on the availability of the markets - from 4:00 pm to 7:30 pm, and on Saturday from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm.
