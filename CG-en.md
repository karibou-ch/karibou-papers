# TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE

## Service

The communication platform ([karibou.ch](http://karibou.ch)) facilitates the connection between individuals who wish to purchase food products and merchants that comply with the karibou.ch charter, who wish to form a common market on the internet and offer a wide range of products for home delivery.

The customer mandates karibou.ch to carry out the purchase and collection of goods from the various shops as well as home delivery or to the address specified by the customer, as long as it is located within the perimeter defined by karibou.ch (see point "Delivery Area").

## Responsibility

Karibou.ch commits to collecting all of a customer's products from the stores on the morning of the delivery day. The maintenance of the cold chain and the perfect packaging of the product are guaranteed.
**The shop commits to offering its products at prices identical to those practiced in its own business**. It is only in the case where it participates in the delivery costs that it is authorized to increase the price of its products accordingly. The shop is responsible for providing products of the highest freshness and quality and conforming to the description presented on the [karibou.ch](http://karibou.ch) site. It is also responsible for the information published on the [karibou.ch](http://karibou.ch) site (e.g. description, ingredient, weight). Concerning cut products, it commits to packaging them on the day of delivery.

## Customer Guarantee

If the customer is not satisfied with the delivered products, they can contact karibou.ch by email at <a class="link" href="mailto:hello@karibou.ch">hello@karibou.ch</a> or by phone <a class="link" href="tel:022 506 80 42">022 506 80 42</a>. All complaints must be made upon receipt of the goods, i.e. the same day of delivery, at the latest the next day. The shop agrees to refund the customer the amount corresponding to the defective merchandise or, by agreement with the customer, to replace the product.

Karibou.ch reserves the right to require proof of defect from the customer before a refund is made.

The guarantee covers defects related to the following aspects: freshness, quality, and degree of ripeness of fruits and vegetables, freshness, and quality of fresh products, non-compliance with the expiration date, breakage during transport, incomplete deliveries, manufacturing or packaging defects.

## Products

Karibou.ch believes that the information provided on the products (e.g. description, ingredients, weight) is correct.

As with any food product, however, the consumer is asked to check for possible contraindications before consumption (e.g. in case of allergy) on the product packaging or on the karibou.ch site. Consumers can contact a shop at any time for additional information on a product.

## Data Protection

Karibou.ch assures the customer that the information they provide when registering on the site is treated with the utmost confidentiality. Karibou.ch transmits personal data to third parties only to the extent necessary for the proper execution of the order or payment (e.g. transmission of data to its financial partner Stripe for online payment, to independent cyclists for delivery).

By registering on the site, the customer tacitly agrees to receive newsletters from karibou.ch, via various communication channels (email, mail). The customer can unsubscribe at any time, easily and free of charge, by following the instructions in the respective message or by contacting <a class="link" href="mailto:hello@karibou.ch">hello@karibou.ch</a>.

## Prices

All prices include VAT at the current rates.

The price of weight-based products is clearly indicated.

For products with variable weight, the final billed price will be adjusted based on the exact weight. A margin of **15% additional** to the order is **reserved** regardless of your payment method (debit/credit card, e-wallet) to allow for these adjustments. After the delivery day, the final invoice is established, and the final payment is made. The difference with the reserved amount is refunded.

Additional costs, for example, shipping fees, surcharges for certain payment methods are not included in the price. They are indicated separately and are or can be charged in addition.

## Items

Karibou.ch reserves the right to limit the purchase quantities of certain products and not to carry out the delivery in the case of an exceptionally heavy or bulky order.

If a product is not available at the time of shipment, it will not be invoiced or sent later. However, karibou.ch may contact the customer and, with their agreement, attempt to find a similar replacement product.

In Switzerland, the purchase of any alcoholic beverage is regulated by law. By purchasing such items, the customer agrees to be of legal age to acquire such products. Alcoholic beverages are prohibited for young people under 16 years of age and any distilled beverage (spirits, pure or diluted aperitifs, and alcopops) for young people under 18 years of age.

## Order Confirmation

The contract comes into force when the customer has placed their order and when this order has been accepted electronically by karibou.ch. The customer can only cancel an order if it has not yet been processed by the concerned shop.

All orders are confirmed by a karibou.ch email. The final charge on your credit or debit card is only made after the goods have been delivered.

## Payment Methods

Payment is made online by debit or credit card. Karibou.ch commits to offering other online payment methods as it develops.

Invoices are sent by email and appear in the customer's account within 2 working days following the delivery of the order.

## Logistics

Karibou.ch bags used for customer delivery must be returned to the delivery person at the next delivery. Karibou.ch reserves the right to charge for non-returned bags.

## Delivery Area

Delivery is limited to the canton of Geneva. The list of all postal codes delivered is available at the time of account creation.

After the order is confirmed by karibou.ch, the ordered items are delivered to the delivery address indicated by the customer.

## Delivery Hours

The customer selects their delivery date, delivery takes place between 4:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.

Delivery times may vary within the time slot and occasionally fall outside this slot.

Absence of the customer at the time of delivery: if the customer is not present at the time of delivery and without any contrary indication on their part, the products are left at their doorstep. Groceries can also be delivered to a neighbor living in the same building if the customer indicates the neighbor's address and phone number during their order. The customer assumes responsibility for the products once delivered, even if they are left at their doorstep or with a neighbor in their absence.

## Legal Information

Karibou.ch cannot guarantee the accuracy, precision, or completeness of the information made available on the site; the photos are not contractual.

In case of disagreement or dispute, the customer agrees to collaborate in a mediation before initiating any legal proceedings.
