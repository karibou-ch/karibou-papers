# THE CHARTER
Karibou.ch aims to bring together, like a market, the food trades that contribute to a sustainable and local economy; baker, cheesemaker, butcher, artisan caterer, beekeeper, grocer, wine merchant, greengrocer, etc.

Food concerns us all. The current distribution system contributes to the environmental problems we know. Food habits, in turn, contribute to many health problems. The purpose of our charter is to gradually lead all food trades towards an ecological and economically viable model for all:

* unite artisanal food trades: bakery, butchery, cheese shop, etc.;
* value the work of importers of grocery stores and greengrocers;
* make products accessible to as many people as possible;
* strive for the most ecological distribution possible.

## Producers, resellers, or artisans on our platform commit to:
* offer high-quality products;
* provide all the information concerning the food sold on Karibou.ch;
* manage their shop responsibly; everyone's work impacts the service offered;
* protect their environment;
* respect social norms regarding their employees, including temporary staff.

## Karibou.ch commits to:
* offer a secure multi-market and multi-merchant web platform for shopping from a computer, tablet, smartphone;
* meet and dialogue with producers, artisans, and merchants wishing to open a store on the site;
* leave each store the choice of the selling price of the products (as long as the prices are identical to those practiced in their own business);
* verify as much as possible the reliability of the information given for each product offered;
* organize deliveries of products by bicycle and electric bicycle in collaboration with a company that understands logistical constraints and respects the cold chain;
* be available to customers and sellers to improve the quality of the service offered.

# Resellers and artisans commit to:
* prioritizing local production;
* the quality and traceability of the products: taste, health, environmental;
* the ingredients used for the preparation of dishes are of local origin when possible;
* no synthetic additives in the preparations, or only when absolutely necessary (in this case, the mention must be explicit).
