### What can I buy on karibou.ch? Under what label/brand (organic, seasonal, ethical, etc.)?

We group together merchants and artisans from the **markets in the canton of Geneva**. As in the markets, you will find an abundant variety of products, some with labels, others without.

Each of them indicates on their product if it is Organic, Biodynamic, local, made by the hands of the artisan, etc.

### Do you operate as a distributor?

The karibou.ch platform is not designed as a resale site but based on the "market" model. Each merchant manages their store by offering their products, commits to a set of criteria unique to them, and is responsible for the quality of their products.

### Is the price of the products increased?

The prices are the same on Karibou as at the market or in the shops. A merchant is allowed to reasonably increase (below 5%) their prices in the case where additional work is justified, and this increase must be clearly indicated to the customer.

### How much does our service and delivery cost?
